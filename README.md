# TwoMapDynSys
Python classes and notebook for reproducing the results in my AustMS Bulletin article on 
fractal transformations constructed from one dimensional dynamical systems which generate symmetric itinerary sets 
(doi.org/10.1017/S0004972719000297).

Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding usage and/or applications of this class.
